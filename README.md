# GLD Lightning data

Each lightning event found within your specified query returns with the following output:

time: Event time with millisecond precision
location: Location of the event in WGS84
signalStrengthKA: Signal strength associated with the event in kiloamperes
cloud: True if the event is an in-cloud event, otherwise false
NOTE: To obtain higher confidence ellipses you can multiply both ellSemiMajM and ellSemiMinM axis by:

1.82 to get a 90% confidence ellipse
2.57 to get a 99% confidence ellipse
When requesting a point and radius request the following output is added:

distanceM: Distance from the requested center point of the radius in meters
When requesting the confidence ellipse the following output is added:

ellipse: Confidence ellipse polygon in WGS84 corresponding to the chosen confidence percentage
When requesting analysis fields the following output is added:

ellSemiMajM: 50% confidence ellipse semi major axis in meters
ellSemiMinM: 50% confidence ellipse semi minor axis in meters
ellAngleDeg: Confidence ellipse semi-major axis angle in degrees East of North
When requesting research fields the following output is added:

numSensors: Number of sensor reports used to compute the solution
chiSquare: Chi-square result from lightning solution
freedom: Degrees of freedom in the computed solution
nsOfMs: The sub-millisecond portion of the time associated with the lightning event in nanoseconds
riseTimeNs: Time duration from threshold crossing to waveform peak in nanoseconds
peakToZeroNs: Time duration from waveform peak to zero-crossing in nanoseconds
maxRateRiseKApUsec: Maximum current rate-of-rise, reported in kiloamperes / Âµsec
When requesting ldi_sdp fields the following output is added:

isStrikePtStart: The initial stroke for a lightning strike point. If True, additional fields are available to evaluate the strike damage potential
numStrokesInStrike: The number of strokes in the strike point. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
numStrokesInStrike: The number of strokes in the strike point. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
continuingCurrentProb: Probability of the strike containing a long continuing current as a value between 0-1. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
metalDmgPotentialPctl: Percentile of the accumulated metallic heating potential from impulse charge to the strike point as a percentile between 0-100. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
nonMetalDmgPotentialPctl: Percentile of the accumulated non-metallic heating potential (specific energy) due to impulse currents to the strike point as a percentile between 0-100. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
impulseChargeC: Estimated accumulated impulse charge for the strike, most relevant for metal objects in Coulombs. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
impulseSpecificEnergyJpO: Estimated accumulated impulse specific energy for the strike, most relevant for non-metal objects in Joules/Ohm. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
strikePtId: Associates the stroke with a defined ground strike point
When requesting research and ldi_sdp fields the following output is added:

numStrikePts: Number of ground strike points in the flash. Only populated if isStrikePtStart is True
